AI-Powered Visual and Audio Interaction with Real-Time Feedback
🚀 A multimodal AI project that processes images and voice input to generate descriptive text and speech responses.

🔹 Overview
This project integrates image-to-text (LLaVA) and speech-to-text (Whisper) models to create an interactive AI system. Users can:
✅ Upload an image → Get a detailed AI-generated description.
✅ Provide voice input → Convert it into text using Whisper.
✅ The AI analyzes the image and answers questions about it.
✅ Generate audio responses using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

🔹 Demo
💻 Try it on Google Colab or host on Hugging Face Spaces.

🔹 Features
✔ Image-to-Text Processing: Uses llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf for detailed image descriptions.
✔ Speech-to-Text: Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe user audio input.
✔ Text-to-Speech: Converts AI-generated text into natural-sounding speech.
✔ Interactive UI: Built with Gradio for a seamless user experience.
